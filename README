DESCRIPTION
-----------
Escape is a 2D top-down game which puts the player in a dungeon-like setting. The objective of the game is to escape
the level (and eventually the dungeon). Players are scored on the amount of time it takes them to complete each level.
When a player progresses, their time follows them. This allows for easy tracking of high scores and enables easy
speed running of the game. Within each level is a series of walls and obstacles that inhibit the player to moving only
within their bounds. This forces the player to find their way to the end like in a maze. The only thing is that they do
not know where the end is. This is achieved by the player having a restricted field of view, limited to only a few
square tiles. This field of view is determined by the difficulty they chose at the start of play. The player will also
encounter skeletons within each level that, when triggered, will follow the player until they get far enough from them
that they are no longer interested. When a skeleton reaches a player, the player will lose a life (of which they start
with three) and will return back to the start of the level. Their time will persist from the moment before death. If the
player loses all of their lives, the game will end and the player's time will be displayed on the screen. Similarly, if
a player is able to beat all levels in the game (currently two exist), a winning message will appear along with the
player's time.

OBJECTIVES
----------
*** Go from the start of each level to the exit (open door) as quick as possible

*** Avoid contact with skeletons

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
The player is controlled using the arrow keys on a keyboard. Each key will move the player in the corresponding
direction. To start the game, either press the space bar to start on the easy difficulty or choose the difficulty
using the number keys one, two, and three (numbers above letter keys) for easy, medium, and hard difficulties
respectively. Upon entering a level or death, the player may be prompted to press the space bar to continue. The
player's time will halt until this is pressed. But once it is, the game is on. Upon losing or winning the game, a game
over screen will display. After a few seconds, the player will be returned to the title screen where they can choose to
play again and select their difficulty.

LOW BAR CHECKLIST
-----------------
*** Constrained Movement
    *** Player and enemy entities are constrained to moving within the bounds of the walls
    *** Player is not required to have precise movements to navigate through tight spaces
*** Collision Detection
    *** Player and enemy entities cannot enter the same space as each other

    *** Player health decreases when coming in contact with an enemy
    *** Collision detection with other collidable objects
*** Enemy's Ability
    *** Collision detection with player entity injures player
    *** State-based movement behavior
